Asteroids (Part 1)
==================
In this assignment we will start to replicate the old video game Asteroids. You will write a program that has a space ship that can be controlled with the keyboard. You will need to write a `SpaceShip` class. Your `SpaceShip` class will extend the `Floater` class, an `abstract` class that represents all things that float in space. 

An `abstract` class is an "incomplete" class. It has `abstract` methods--incomplete methods that have no body. When your class extends an `abstract` class, you typically write the methods that are needed to "complete" the class. _Note: To complete this assignment you will be writing two classes `SpaceShip` and `Star`. Do not modify the `Floater` class._

Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/APCSLowell/AsteroidsGame).
2. Uncomment the `extends floater` on Line 10
3. Complete the 10 abstract `set` and `get` functions
4. Write the `Spaceship` constructor. Make sure you initialize all 9 of the inherited `protected` member variables. You may find slides #1 - 58 on the [Asteroids PowerPoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTYjU0NDE5ZDYtYzEwOS00MGNlLTk0OGMtODBhODI3N2JiYzRi/view?usp=sharing) and the [SpaceShip design worksheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTRDJvNUJRdXFjNGs/view?usp=sharing) helpful. You may also find [this sample SpaceShip program](https://56d4b6566b56a59e1f634ea30f548666c459899d.googledrive.com/host/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTallTVFJBOWdNcDQ/) helpful in understanding how the `protected Floater` variables affect the SpaceShip's movement.
5. At the top of your program, declare a variable of type `SpaceShip`
6. Initialize the `SpaceShip` as a new instance of the class
7. In `draw()` call the SpaceShip's `show()` function
8. When you are happy with appearance of the SpaceShip, add a `public void keyPressed()` function to your program
9. Write code in `keyPressed` that allows you to control the space ship with the keyboard. You must include the ability to rotate left, rotate right, accelerate, and enter "hyperspace." (There is no requirement for any fancy visual effects, hyperspace just needs to stop the ship, and give it a new random position and direction.)
10. Add code to `draw()` to `move()` the Spaceship
11. Finally, add a `Star` class that creates a random number of stars in random positions
12. Note that for full credit, **you MUST include instructions on how to operate your SpaceShip in the `index.html` file**
12. If you have extra time and are looking for a challenge, you might try to add an animation of "rockets" that appear from the back of the ship when you accelerate

These steps are only a suggestion. Your Asteroids game doesn't have to work or act like any other. Have fun and be creative.

Asteroids (Part 2)
==================
Now that we have a functioning space ship, we'll add some asteroids to our game. We'll write an asteroid class that `extends Floater`.

Steps to completing this assignment
-----------------------------------

1. Write an Asteroid class that extends Floater. Make sure it's not inside the curly braces of any other class. You will need to
write a constructor and the code to "finish" the `abstract` methods in the Floater class
2. Add a `int` member variable of the `Asteroid` class. It will hold the speed of rotation for each asteroid. Make sure that this is initialized to have an equal probablility of being positive or negative. Also make sure to declare it appropriately (should it be `public` or `private`?)
3. "Override" the `move()` method of the Floater class by writing a new `move()` method in the Asteroid class that also rotates each Asteroid at its own speed
4. Now add just a single asteroid to your applet. Start by just calling the Asteroid's `show()` function. Make sure you can see it and are happy with its shape before going to the next step.
5. Now add the code that moves and rotates the Asteroid
6. Modify your code so that you have an array of Asteroids.
7. Submit the URL of your working program to the school loop locker

Extensions
----------

If you have extra time, you might try to figure out how to check to see if the ship has collided with an asteroid.

Asteroids (Part 3) 
==================
Adding an `ArrayList`
-------------------
An array probably isn't the best way to keep track of a bunch of asteroids. Arrays have a fixed size. You can't easily add or remove asteroids from an array. A better choice might be an `ArrayList`. The `ArrayList` class has a number of useful member methods:
- `boolean add(Object x)`
- `void add(int index, Object element)`
- `Object get(int index)`
- `Object remove(int index)`
- `Object set(int index, Object x)`
- `int size()`

Steps to completing this assignment
-----------------------------------

1. Modify your asteroids game to use an `ArrayList` instead of an array of asteroids. You may find the Asteroids powerpoint from slides #124 helpful. There is more on ArrayLists on the [ArrayList worksheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTQjFTMjhPaGNXb1E/view?usp=sharing).
2. Now we'll modify the program so that when our space ship strikes an asteroid, the asteroid is removed from the `ArrayList`. Everytime an asteroid moves find the distance between that asteroid and the ship. Use processing's `dist()` function to find the distance between that asteroid and the ship. If the distance is less than 20 remove the asteroid from the ArrayList. Otherwise, move and rotate the asteroid normally
3. Submit the same URL for your AsteroidsGame that you submitted for the two previous assignments to the school loop drop box.

Asteroids (Part 4) 
==================
Adding bullets and finishing the game
-------------------------------------
To finish our Asteroids game, we need to write a new class that represents Bullets. We will store the Bullets in an `ArrayList` much like we did with the Asteroids. Once we can shoot the bullets and destroy Asteroids, we will have a working game. Your Asteroids game doesn't have to look like any other. Feel free to modify it in any way you wish.

Suggested steps to completing this assignment
---------------------------------------------

1. Write a `Bullet` class that `extends Floater`. 
2. Write a constructor that takes one ship argument: `Bullet(SpaceShip theShip)` This constructor will:
  - Intialize `myCenterX` and `myCenterY` of the bullet to be the same as the ship.
  - Initialize `myPointDirection` of the bullet to be the same as `myPointDirection` of the ship
  - convert `myPointDirectio`n to radians with the following code: `double dRadians =myPointDirection*(Math.PI/180);`
  - Initialize `myDirectionX` as `5 * Math.cos(dRadians) + the myDirectionX` of the ship
  - Initialize `myDirectionY` as `5 * Math.sin(dRadians) + the myDirectionY` of the ship
3. Override the `show()` method of the `Floater` class so that you can use circular bullets
4. Now, add just one bullet to your program. First, just draw it to the screen. Make sure you can see it before continuing to the next step.
5. Now, move the bullet.
6. Now create an `ArrayList` of Bullets. The list should be empty to start with. Everytime you press the key to "shoot", add a `new Bullet` to the `ArrayList`. Modify the program with loops that draw and move all the bullets in the ArrayList
7. One way to check for collisions between the bullets and the Asteroids is to write a loop within a loop (see below for another way). Everytime you move one asteroid you will need:
  - a loop that goes through all the bullets to see if there is a collision between that bullet and the asteroid
  - if there is a collision remove both the asteroid and the bullet from their `ArrayLists`
8. Alternatively, you might be able to use processing's `get()` to check for collisions.
9. (Note: I'm not sure if this is still true in the current version of Processing)If your finished program is running slowly, try changing `size(`) to use P2D. For example, `size(600,600,P2D);` creates an applet 600 x 600 that uses processing's fast 2D renderer (which is not as accurate as the default renderer).
10. Submit the same URL for your AsteroidsGame that you submitted for the three previous assignments to the school loop drop box.

Extensions
----------
If you have extra time, you might add some extra features to your Asteroids game. Have fun and be creative!
* Randomly shaped Asteroids
* Different types of weapons besides bullets
* Have two Asteroids classes, one large and one small. When a large Asteroid is removed from the ArrayList add two small ones with the same x and y
* Add a UFO that appears after a while and shoots at the space ship
* Keep track of the score and/or the health of the ship
